<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Arshiv!</p>

<p>I am a mechanical engingeering graduate from Stellenbosch University. I started my university career in 2016 after making 
it into the EDP programme at Stellenbosch. At first I was dissapointed in getting into the 5 year course, but I soon came to
terms with it and realized that I should make the best of this opportunity.</p>

<p>I soon got to know many different people who were both smart and driven to achieve their goals. It was a great learning experience
  for me. I made new friends at every corner and I learnt a lot about the different circumstances that people grew up in.
  Not everyone had the same upbringing as me. I was lucky, and I gained a new appreciation for what my parents were willing to do to
  help me succeed. 
</p>

<p>Engineering was tough, at times there were points where I wanted to pull all my hair out. The frustration of tough tests, 
  projects, assignments and tutorials left me on the brink of my sanity. There were many late nights where I would sleep at 
  3am, just pushing to get my projects done and meet deadlines. Times like these may break people, but through determination and 
  sheer will power, I managed to make it through all these tough times.
</p>

<p>My perserverence finally paid off as I walked up on stage to get my hard earned degree in 2022. It may have taken me two extra years, 
  but I was proud of my accomplishment. There are many people who drop out an lose motivation, but I proved that I could push on and 
  accomplish something if I put my mind to it. 
</p>

<p>Right now, I am trying to move into the IT sector. While at campus, there was part of my degree that I enjoyed thoroughly.
  This was coding. I could sit for hours non-stop, just trying to figure out a problem. My thesis was one that revolved around creating a 
  numerical solution which would model the heating of a water heater. I was ecstatic as it meant that I had to code a numerical solution.
  This was one of the things that pushed me to try and get into the IT field. 
</p>

<p>I am currently pursuing a 6-month course at VZAP in which I learn software development with Java. I am also pursuing 
  online course in order to gain more skills, such as python for data analysis and web development to improve my knowledge in the 
  field.
